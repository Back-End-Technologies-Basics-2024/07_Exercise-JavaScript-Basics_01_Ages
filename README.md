Write a function that determines whether based on the given age a person is: baby, child, teenager, adult, elder.
The input comes as a single number parameter. The age boundaries are:
·	0-2 – baby;   
·	3-13 – child; 
·	14-19 – teenager;
·	20-65 – adult;
·	>=66 – elder; 
·	In all other cases print – "out of bounds".
The output should be printed to the console.
